1. Use the current observation and goal to choose the next executable command.
2. Output exactly one action inside exactly one <action>...</action> tag.
3. Do not output a multi-step plan; only the next environment action will be executed.
4. If a <valid_action_constraint> block is present, it overrides assistant suggestions and all other action-format guidance; copy exactly one listed action into <action>...</action>.
5. If no <valid_action_constraint> block is present and the current observation says the previous action was invalid, output <action>check valid actions</action>.
6. If no <valid_action_constraint> block is present and you are unsure which actions are available, output <action>check valid actions</action>.
7. Prefer actions that increase or preserve goal satisfaction; do not move an object away from a satisfied goal unless necessary.
8. After the action is executed, you will receive an observation of the new state.

Example output:
<action>pick ball1 rooma right</action>"""
